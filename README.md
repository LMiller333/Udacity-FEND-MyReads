# MyReads Project

I completed this project as part of my Grow with Google Scholarship/Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree Program. This project demonstrates my React development skills, including UI components, input handling, control handling, routing, and state management.

Note that this project relied on a template provided by Udacity, which was generated using Create React App. 

## To Run the App

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the server with `npm start`

## When Searching
The backend API provided by Udacity only permits a limited set of search terms. These can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). 

## Key Files & Components
### App.js
Contains core app functionality, states, some UI, and routing to main pages (SearchResults & Shelves)
### Shelves.js
Contains UI and logic for the home page, which displays books that have been placed on the various "shelves" (currently reading, want to read, etc.)
### SearchResults.js
Contains UI and logic for the search results page, which displays books that match the search query
### Book.js
Contains UI for individual book UI

## Dependencies
-[React](https://reactjs.org/): A Javascript library for building user interfaces
-[BooksAPI](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) - A backend tester server provided by Udacity

## Starter Template

This project was initiated using a [starter template provided by Udacity] (https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter), which was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
